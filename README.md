- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShreedipDas
- I am an undergrad at the California State University, Fresno as an international student from India.
- I am majoring in computer science.
- Even though I am majoring in computer science, my interests lean heavily toward Data Science and analytics. Hopefully, my academic background as a computer science graduate will provide a solid foundation when I dive deep into the world of data.
- I am currently learning Data Science on my own and this platform will be a way for me to document and present my journey from day one.
